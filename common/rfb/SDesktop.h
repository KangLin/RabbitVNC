// SDesktop is an interface implemented by back-ends, on which callbacks are
// made by the VNCServer as appropriate for pointer and keyboard events, etc.
// SDesktop objects are always created before the VNCServer - the SDesktop
// will be passed a pointer to the VNCServer in the start() call.  If a more
// implementation-specific pointer to the VNCServer is required then this
// can be provided to the SDesktop via an implementation-specific method.
//
// An SDesktop usually has an associated PixelBuffer which it tells the
// VNCServer via the VNCServer's setPixelBuffer() method.  It can do this at
// any time, but the PixelBuffer MUST be valid by the time the call to start()
// returns.  The PixelBuffer may be set to null again if desired when stop() is
// called.  Note that start() and stop() are guaranteed to be called
// alternately; there should never be two calls to start() without an
// intervening stop() and vice-versa.
